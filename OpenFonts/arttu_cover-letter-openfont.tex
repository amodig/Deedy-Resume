\lettercontent{Dear Recruiter,}

\lettercontent{I'm an engineer (M.Sc. in Biomedical Engineering) who majored in machine learning and statistics. After spending some time in quite interdisciplinary academia, I got an interesting job in Business Intelligence at the slot machine game company RAY. Then, after the fusion of Finnish gambling companies, I found myself doing intensive data analysis and revenue optimization in web sales and marketing at Veikkaus. Eventually I wanted a change of prospects, and a mobile gaming startup Armada Interactive was looking for a skilled data analyst. At Armada, my pool of skills has extended to modern ETL cloud processes and constructing highly available and dynamic visual analytics. I've also been involved in market research and data-driven product design and development.}

\lettercontent{Currently I'm a bit in love with the modern Finnish gaming industry, as I've met many excellent colleagues and seen how fun and fulfilling it can be to work in a lean and flat organization with a lot of transparency. But I've also seen how much core business can still have room to improve in the use of analytics, empirical testing and advanced statistical modeling, aside from the basic need for even broader automation and information visualization.}

\lettercontent{That's why I'm really interested in Futureplay; your core business model seems to be very dynamic and based on very rational market research and data-informed decision making. I believe that my views on making succesful products and services are aligned, and I could reinforce and augment your vision with my extensive skills, open communication and fresh ideas.}

\closing{Sincerely,}%\\ \vspace{.1cm} \includegraphics[width=4cm]{signature} \vspace{-1cm} }
